#N#
Dear #N#,
Now it the time for all good people to come to the aid of the University.
For if the good people do not come to the aid of the University the
thing may break up and go down the drain. Should this happen, #N#, the
drain could stop up. Once the Fall monsoons come, with the drains stopped
up, we could drown like rats.
Now, #N#, we know you are a good person. Shouldn't you contribute to
the aid of the country by contributing a large sum to your impoverished
professors' welfare?
Sincerely,
Bjorn Berger, Chairman,
The University Committee for Student Contributions to
the Betterment of Faculty Welfare.
